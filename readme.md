##About. 
This repository will demonstrate all the concepts I have learned from this course. 

Concepts I have learned are. 

* Vector Sorting methods

* Data Structures

* Lists 

* Hashtables 

* Binary Search Trees

## Course reflection.:mag_right:
The Problem I tried to solve was creating a program for a client. In this scenario, the program was developed with the intention to open and read inputs from a file and then sort that file via one of the three data structures provided. The data structure I choose was a Binary Search tree.

The approach I took was to revisit some learning modules to find examples of data structures for Binary Search Trees (BST). I then reviewed the requirements for the course and determined how to implement the data being stored. The data would need to be stored in a vector and then use sorting features to push the data into the vectors. Then I tried to create a solution for the program so it would produce an acceptable run time. It's important to understand data structures because they can be used to optimize and create efficient solutions to problems. and understanding run time will help improve usability when handling large data sets. 

The work in the project expanded on the concepts of using BST data structures because out of the three data structures, BST, Hashtables, and Linked List the BST produced the fastest run time but is a bit more complex to implement in my option. I also left FIXME notes to further improve the application.

This project has taught me to create programs by creating a maintainable application by using data structures to help improve the performance of the code and using hpp or h files to promote mentality by sharing data between different fields. And creating constructors to help promote polymorphism within the file.
